A deep learning project that predicts stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a soft computing technique under artificial neural networks.

🚀 Features
- Downloads real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance
- Implements 3-layer LSTM model with Dropout regularization
- Includes model checkpointing and early stopping
- Visualizes predictions vs actual prices
- Ready-to-use modular code structure

⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-detection.git
cd stock-price-detection
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

🧠 Training the Model
```bash
python training.py
```
- Default ticker: AAPL (Apple Inc.)
- Time period: 2010-01-01 to 2020-12-31
- Model saved as `models/best_model.h5`

🔮 Making Predictions
```bash
python predict.py
```
- Tests on 2021 data by default
- Generates `stock_prediction.png` comparing actual vs predicted prices

🛠️ Customization
- Change stock ticker in both files
- Modify `look_back` period (default: 60 days)
- Adjust LSTM layers in `training.py`
